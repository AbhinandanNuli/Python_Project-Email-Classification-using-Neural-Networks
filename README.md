# Python_Project-Email-Classification-using-Neural-Networks

Problem Statement:
In this project, the goal is to classify the emails into 20 categories based on the words present in each of the email. Here I have used Deep Neural Networks in order to classify the data and I have taken 18,846 observations (11,314 for training the model and 7,532 for testing) and its corresponding classes/categories are 20. The data has been preprocessed using Natural Language Processing techniques to obtain the word vectors to map the final output.

The NLP steps involved are: Pre-processing, Removal of punctuations, Word tokenization, Converting words into lowercase, Stop word removal, Keeping words of length of at least 3, Stemming words, POS tagging, Lemmatization of words. 

The Libraries used in the project are Keras, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit Learn
